# MultiVerse Assets: Dynamic NFT Marketplace & Gaming Platform

A Clarity smart contract that implements a multi-token standard (similar to ERC1155) with integrated marketplace and gaming mechanics on the Stacks blockchain. This contract allows for the creation, management, and trading of both fungible and non-fungible tokens with dynamic properties.

## Features

### Token Management
- Create new token types (fungible/non-fungible)
- Mint tokens with customizable supply caps
- Track token ownership and balances
- Store token metadata and properties
- Support for both fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract

### Marketplace Functions
- Create listings for any token
- Cancel existing listings
- Purchase tokens using STX
- Automated transfer handling
- Secure transaction processing

### Gaming Mechanics
- Level-up system for tokens
- Experience points tracking
- Dynamic property updates
- Rarity system
- Timestamp tracking for modifications

### Security Features
- Comprehensive input validation
- Role-based access control
- Safe arithmetic operations
- Detailed error handling
- Guard against common attack vectors
